# Public Defold Examples
Small examples for the Defold engine

## Live examples
See some of the examples live [here](http://britzl.github.io/publicexamples/).

## How to try the examples yourself
Each example is located in a subfolder of the `examples` folder. You can either copy all of the files to your own project and make sure all paths are correct or you can fork this project and create a new empty Defold project and [change the remote repository](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-remote-s-url/) of the project to your fork of the example project.
